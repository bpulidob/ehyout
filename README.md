# Area-based epigraph and hypograph indices for functional outlier detection.

Code and data to reproduce the results presented in the paper 
*Area-based epigraph and hypograph indices for functional outlier detection* 
by Pulido B., Franco-Pereira A.M., Lillo R.E., and Scheipl F.

The Figures included in the paper are available in the plots folder and the code
needed to generate them is available in code folder in the following way:

- Section 3:
  - Up to Section 3.1 including Appendix A: plots_paper.R
  - Section 3.2: elections.R
- Section 4: plots_simulation_study.R
- Section 5: real_data.R

Tables in Appendix B are generated from the code in simul_bench.R and the files 
saved in results folder as table_DGPname_100.rds and table_DGPname_100.tex

The R packages and the versions used for this work are listed below:
